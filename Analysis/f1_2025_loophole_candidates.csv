the engine by reducing friction and to reduce wear. It also cleans, inhibits corrosion, improves 
sealing, and cools the engine by carrying heat away from moving parts. Engine oils should not

requests, and they will be registered as such after approval by the other PU Manufacturers 
and the FIA. For such minor modifications, the PU Manufacturer may also request the 
possibility of exhausting the existing stock of parts alongside the use of the modified parts,
